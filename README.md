## My process

### Technology used

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/): A modern framework for fast, optimized static site generation with a component-based approach. 🚀

### What I learned

- Gained insights into organizing a fully-fledged project and implementing effective component architecture. 🛠️
- Enhanced skills in styling with Sass within Astro and built dynamic UI components using Swiper. 🎨🚀
- Improved understanding of static site development. 🌐

### Continued development

I’m impressed by Astro’s ease of use for static sites. 🌟 I plan to use Astro in future projects for its flexibility and performance, making it ideal for creating fast and optimized content-rich websites. 🚀
